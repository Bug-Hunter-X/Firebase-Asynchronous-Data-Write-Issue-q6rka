This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase projects where asynchronous operations are not handled correctly, leading to data write failures. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, attempting to access the result of an asynchronous `set()` operation synchronously.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code using `.then()` to handle the asynchronous nature of the operation properly.
